### Deepsite Prompt 1: Landing Page (unchanged from before, but included for completeness)
Create a clean, minimal landing page in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for a "Text to ICS Converter". Include a prominent header: "Text to ICS Converter". Below it, provide two input options: a drag-and-drop zone for uploading a plain text file, and a large textarea for pasting text directly. The expected text format is one appointment per line: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM-HH:MM (e.g., 2026-01-10 09:00-10:30). Add a "Convert" button that reads the input (from file or textarea), parses it, stores the resulting array in localStorage as JSON, and redirects to review.html. Show a simple error message if input is empty or malformed. Use responsive CSS, no external frameworks. All events share the same title "Appointment".

### Deepsite Prompt 2: Review Page (updated - no editing, read-only with sorting)
Generate a read-only review page in HTML and CSS for displaying parsed appointments before downloading the ICS file. Retrieve the appointment data from localStorage (a JSON array of objects with date, startTime, endTime). Display all appointments in a clean table with columns: Date, Start Time, End Time, and a formatted preview like "Appointment on January 10, 2026 from 09:00 to 10:30". Add sorting controls at the top: buttons or dropdown for "Sort by Date Ascending" and "Sort by Date Descending" (default to ascending). The table must update dynamically when sorting is changed. Include a prominent "Download ICS File" button at the top and bottom. Use simple, modern CSS for readability and responsiveness. Header: "Review Your Appointments". No editing capabilities—everything is read-only. Assume shared title is "Appointment".

### Gemini CLI Prompt: Add Backend Logic (updated for read-only and sorting)
Take the HTML/CSS from the landing and review pages generated by Deepsite. Add full vanilla JavaScript functionality. For the landing page: handle drag-and-drop (read text file), textarea input, basic validation, parse each line with regex into {date, startTime, endTime}, store as JSON in localStorage under key 'appointments', then redirect to review.html. For the review page: on load, retrieve and parse the JSON from localStorage. Render a table with the appointments, formatting dates nicely (e.g., full month name). Implement sorting: add event listeners to sort buttons/dropdown—sort the array by date ascending or descending, then re-render the table. On "Download ICS File" click, generate a valid ICS string: BEGIN:VCALENDAR, multiple VEVENT blocks with SUMMARY:Appointment, DTSTART/DTEND in ISO 8601 format (YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ, assume UTC), proper UID per event, END:VEVENT, END:VCALENDAR. Create a Blob, generate download link, trigger download as "appointments.ics". Include basic error handling if no data. Use only vanilla JS, embed scripts in the HTML files.
